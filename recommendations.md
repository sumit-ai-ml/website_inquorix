# Inquor Pre-Launch Website Recommendations

## Brand & Story
- Align the product name across every page (title tag, navigation, hero copy) and settle on a single brand voice.
- Weave the origin story (Inquor comes from “Insight + Core,” the core of understanding) into the hero subheading or an about strip.
- Add a concise sub-heading that clarifies the product promise, target customer, and launch timing right under the hero headline.
- Rework CTA language so it fits the pre-launch stage (e.g., “Join the waitlist”, “Get early access”) and echo the same phrasing throughout the site.

## Visual Design & Layout
- Break up long stretches of white by alternating subtle background gradients or textures and introducing a prominent product mockup.
- Replace placeholder logo images in the trust section with real partners/press, a text-based credibility statement, or hide the section until assets are ready.
- Tune the typographic scale so each section steps down from the hero and feels calmer on smaller screens.

## Pre-Launch Conversion
- Swap `mailto:` CTAs for a short embedded waitlist form or modal so visitors can sign up without leaving the page.
- Introduce a “What’s coming” or roadmap strip outlining upcoming milestones to build anticipation.
- Surface primary CTAs above the fold and reiterate them near the demo/request sections to reinforce the conversion path.

## Content Polish
- Consolidate repetitive feature cards into a smaller set of differentiated benefits and add supporting data or “Coming soon” tags.
- Hide or replace testimonial blocks until you have authentic quotes from pilot users or beta testers.
- Remove or relabel footer links that point to `#` so visitors are not confronted with dead ends.

## Blog Experience
- Tighten the blog hero layout, add metadata/breadcrumbs, and ensure category counts reflect real content or mark them as “Coming soon”.
- Close each post preview with a waitlist CTA to funnel readers back toward conversion.
- Keep the blog styling consistent with the main site but adjust spacing so it reads like a real publishing surface, not a duplicate homepage.

## Technical Touches
- Provide a real favicon under `static/favicon.ico` or remove the tag until it exists to avoid 404s in the console.
- Load a consistent brand font (e.g., Poppins as mentioned in the README) so the visual identity matches the documented design system.
- Audit scripts and assets to confirm that only necessary libraries ship in production, keeping the landing page lean and fast.
